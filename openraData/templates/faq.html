    <h3>My map is not found on dedicated servers anymore but it was there earlier!</h3>
    <p>There can be several reasons, most common are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>OpenRA Resource Center performed scheduled check&amp;upgrade of all maps for newer OpenRA version. If it affected your map, it's hash changed and dedicated servers synced a new file. You need to download it again.</li>
        <li>There is a newer revision of your map (dedicated servers sync only the latest revision).</li>
        <li>Your map was reported by 3 or more users, that closed map for downloading by OpenRA client and for dedicated servers (even if reports had been canceled).</li>
    </ul>
